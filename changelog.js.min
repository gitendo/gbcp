Missing files and urls have been added."},{"date":"Jul 13th, 2020","text":"aPack unpacker added. PuCrunch loses its place."},{"date":"May 26th, 2019","text":"As you can see there\u0027s no clear winner. Compression was always about speed vs. size and it\u0027s no different here. RNC method 1 does the best job packing tile data but unoptimized unpacker is slowest, largest and needs a lot of RAM. PuCrunch is second being 21 bytes behind but wins when it comes to attributes file. Then we have C64Pack, just 2 bytes behind PuCrunch. Map file was too much for gb-lzss, RNC method 2 and SWD32 which failed miserably. Surprisingly kirbyLzRle, which uses mixed LZ-RLE based on HAL Laboratory packer, wins hand down here. GB Compress wins honorable mention being the fastest - apparently unpacking map file is faster than copying it usual way!"}]';
